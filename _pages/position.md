We are seeking highly motivated **PhD candidates** and **Postdoctoral researchers** in the areas of scientific machine learning and applied mathematics.

Our research investigates the mathematical foundations of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), with a focus on rigorous analysis, probability theory, and modern deep learning methodologies. We aim to develop efficient, provably convergent algorithms and architectures for high-dimensional problems in science and engineering. This involves integrating the mathematical analysis and numerics of PDEs with modern learning-based techniques, and combining theoretical investigation (approximation rates, statistical limits) with the development of practical, domain-aware algorithms.

## Research Focus

Successful candidates will contribute to our research in areas such as:

-   **Operator Learning:** Developing and analyzing neural operator architectures for solving PDEs and approximating infinite-dimensional mappings or dynamical systems.
-   **Inverse Problems & Uncertainty Quantification:** Bayesian inference, posterior consistency, and generative modeling (measure transport, diffusion models, flow matching) for parameter estimation in high dimensions.
-   **Structure-Preserving ML:** Integrating physical constraints (conservation laws, symmetries) into learning frameworks.
-   **Optimization & Sampling:** Analysis and applications of particle-based methods, mean-field limits, diffusion processes.

We also welcome applicants with strong theoretical backgrounds who wish to propose their own research directions within the scope of the group's interests.

## Your Profile

-   **PhD Candidates:** Excellent Master's degree in Mathematics, Physics, or Computer Science. Strong background in analysis, probability, optimization, or numerical mathematics. Interest in interdisciplinary research at the interface of math and AI.
-   **Postdocs:** PhD in Mathematics or a related field with a strong publication record in SciML, numerical analysis, optimization, or statistical learning theory.
-   Programming proficiency is desirable (Python/PyTorch/JAX).

## We Offer

-   **Duration:**
    -   **PhD:** 75% initially for **3 years**
    -   **Postdoc:** 100% for **2 years**
-   **Teaching:** Moderate teaching duties (4 SWS), such as supervising tutorials and seminars
-   Access to high-performance computing resources

At Heidelberg University, we are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive community. We encourage applications from women and individuals from underrepresented groups and strive to create a supportive and welcoming environment for all members of our community.

## Application Process

Please send your application as a single PDF file to **Prof. Jakob Zech** ([jakob.zech@uni-heidelberg.de](mailto:jakob.zech@uni-heidelberg.de)).

**Important:** Please use the subject line **"Application [PhD/Postdoc] - [Your Name]"**.

The (soft) deadline is **January 11, 2026**. All applications received by this date will be given full consideration. Afterwards, applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis until the positions are filled. The application should include:

-   A motivation letter outlining your research interests
-   Your CV
-   Contact details of two referees
-   **For PhD candidates:** Transcripts of records (Bachelor and Master)
-   **For Postdoc candidates:** A brief research statement and copies of 1-2 representative publications
